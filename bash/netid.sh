# TASK 1: Accept options on the command line for verbose mode and an interface name - must use the while loop and case command as shown in the lesson - getopts not acceptable for this task
#         If the user includes the option -v on the command line, set the variable $verbose to contain the string "yes"
#            e.g. network-config-expanded.sh -v
#         If the user includes one and only one string on the command line without any option letter in front of it, only show information for that interface
#            e.g. network-config-expanded.sh ens34
#         Your script must allow the user to specify both verbose mode and an interface name if they want
